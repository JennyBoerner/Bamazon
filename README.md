# Bamazon

## Description
Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront node application using MySQL. The app takes in orders from customers, checks current stock levels and either lets the customer place the order or tells them that the item is out of stock. If there is enough stock for the purchase, the stock level will be depleted and the total price will be shown to the customer.

## User Input
node index.js <br/>
The user will then be prompted to input the product ID and the quantity they want to purchase.
